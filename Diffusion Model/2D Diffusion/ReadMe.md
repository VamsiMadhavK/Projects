##Diffusion simulation
This is a simple diffusion simulation in Python. It uses NumPy and Matplotlib to create a 3D visualization of the diffusion process.

The simulation works by randomly moving particles around a grid. The particles can move in any direction, but they are more likely to move to adjacent grid cells than to move further away. The simulation runs for a specified number of iterations, and at each iteration, a new grid is created that shows the current location of the particles.

The simulation can be used to study the diffusion process in a variety of contexts. For example, it can be used to study the movement of molecules in a liquid or gas, or the movement of cells in a tissue.

To run the simulation, simply open the diffusion.ipynb file in a Jupyter notebook. The simulation will run automatically, and the results will be displayed in a new window.
